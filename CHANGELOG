🚀 Version 3.0.0 — Major Refactor and Rearchitecture

This release represents a complete modernization of amcrest2mqtt, bringing cleaner structure, better MQTT handling, and richer event data.

Highlights

  - Modularized codebase under src/amcrest2mqtt/

  - Brand-new MqttMixin with resilient reconnect, structured logs, and HA rediscovery support

  - HelpersMixin for device-state building and service-level control commands

  - AmcrestApiMixin replaces direct device calls with consolidated error handling

  - New sensor.event_time (timestamp) and sensor.event_text entities for human-readable event tracking

  - Added doorbell and human detection binary sensors for supported models (AD110/AD410)

  - Proper Home Assistant schema compliance: ISO 8601 timestamps, availability templates, and via-device linkage

  - Clean shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT and improved signal management

  - Full developer environment setup (black, ruff, pytest, coverage settings)

  - Utility script tools/clear_mqtt.sh for clearing retained topics

  - Docker image metadata updated with links, license, and version labels

Breaking Changes

  - Moved all code to src/ package layout — update imports and mount paths if using bind mounts.

  - MQTT topics slightly restructured for consistency across entities.

  - Deprecated util.py; its helpers are now integrated into mixins.

1.0.1
  - lookup camera hostnames to get ip at setup time, so we aren't doing
    100k lookups every day (in my 4 camera setup, for example)
